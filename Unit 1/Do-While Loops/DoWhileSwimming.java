// Both galllant and Goofus swim the same time at 80 temperature
// Gallant does not swim at 78 temerature but Goofus swims for 1 min.
// Yes gallant checks the water temperature first then dives in Goofus does not.
//While loops check the condition first and then execute the code, whereas the do while loop will execute the statement(s) at least once, then the condition is checked.
// The post Test executes the while loop and the pre-test loop executes the do while loop.
